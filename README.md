The project focuses on building a Learning Management System (LMS), essentially a platform where educators and students can interact seamlessly. For educators, the system allows the easy creation of courses with a user-friendly interface. They can name their courses, structure them into chapters, and add relevant pages to each chapter. Educators also get access to insightful reports showing how many students are enrolled in their courses.

On the student side, the system ensures a hassle-free experience. New students can sign up by providing basic information, while returning ones can easily log in. Students can explore courses, see chapter previews before enrolling, and mark pages as complete to track their progress. The system displays enrolled courses separately for quick access. Additional features like search functionality and quizzes enhance the learning journey. Developers are encouraged to follow best practices, including thorough testing and regular updates to a GitHub repository, ensuring a reliable and original project.
